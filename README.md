# Expo CLI: Background Task Incompatibility Error

This repository demonstrates a scenario where a background task in an Expo app fails to start in the simulator due to incompatibility or incorrect configuration.

## Problem

When running the app in the iOS simulator (and potentially Android emulator), the background task defined using `expo-task-manager` fails to start, throwing an error that's not always immediately obvious.

## Solution

The solution often involves carefully reviewing the `expo-task-manager` documentation, ensuring the task is properly defined, and verifying that all necessary permissions are correctly requested and granted.

This might also involve updating the Expo SDK version or checking compatibility with other libraries used in your project.

Additional troubleshooting steps might be necessary depending on the specific error messages or logs.
